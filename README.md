# Epic Stack Example: `has-js` class

This is an example implementation of using CSS to ensure that users who don't
have js enabled have as good a user experience as possible without degrading the
experience of users who do have js enabled.

Inspired by [@jjenzz](https://twitter.com/jjenzz/status/1720939490233946300).

Check the commit history for what it took to implement this.

To run this locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/epic-stack-example-has-js-class
cd epic-stack-example-has-js-class
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, login as a
user, and go to the create new note page to find the image uploader. Try it with
and without JS enabled to have the full experience.
